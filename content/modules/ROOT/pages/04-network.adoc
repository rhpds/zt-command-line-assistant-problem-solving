== Network troubleshooting

The command line assistant is useful for configuring and troubleshooting
RHEL networking. In this assignment we’ll use command line assistant to
help us configure DNS as well as port redirection.

== Configuring DNS

Let’s ask command line assistant what our DNS is configured to.

[source,bash,run]
----
c "how do I determine my dns server in rhel10"
----

The output should look something like this.

.View DNS
image::view_dns.png[../assets/view_dns]

Let’s run the suggested command.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/resolv.conf
----

The output will look like this.

.View DNS

Let’s add another DNS server.

[source,bash,run]
----
c "how do I configure the dns server to 8.8.8.8 from the command line?"
----

The output will look like this.

.Configure DNS

When you run `+nmcli connection show+`, multiple connections are
returned.

[source,bash,run]
----
nmcli connection show
----

.Nmcli connection show
image::nmcli_con_show.png[../assets/nmcli_con_show]

Let's configure the DNS server as suggested by command line assistant.

[source,bash,run]
----
nmcli connection modify Wired\ connection\ 1 ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
----

Then we need to activate the connection.

[source,bash,run]
----
nmcli connection up Wired\ connection\ 1
----

Check the results.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/resolv.conf
----

We can see that `+8.8.8.8+` is now configured as a DNS server.
