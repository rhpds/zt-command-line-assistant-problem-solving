Welcome to the command line assistant problem solving lab.

command line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed is intended to provide
rapid access to Red Hat knowledge to help users solve problems as
quickly as possible, through a natural language interface.

In this challenge, we’ll get acquainted with the command line assistant.
