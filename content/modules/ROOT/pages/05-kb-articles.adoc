Command line assistant has the ability to return answers that make use
of a Retrieval Augmented Generation database that provides Red Hat
Enterprise Linux-specific knowledge.

For example, let’s try asking command line assistant the following
question.

[source,bash,run]
----
c "what is simple content access"
----

Simple Content Access (SCA) is a simplified subscription model and
command line assistant can return the full definition and links to
additional documentation.

On the topic of subscriptions, let’s ask command line assistant how to
use `+subscription-manager+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
c "what is subscription-manager"
----

As you can see we are provided a summary on how to use
`+subscription-manager+`.

Ansible core is included with a RHEL subscription. Ask command line
assistant what it is.

[source,bash,run]
----
c "what is ansible-core"
